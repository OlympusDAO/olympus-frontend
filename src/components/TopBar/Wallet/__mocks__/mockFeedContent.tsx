If you’re new or need a refresher, you can read the first <a href="https://olympusdao.medium.com/olympusdao-fundamentals-the-foundations-of-web3s-decentralized-reserve-currency-ce892008fba">Olympus Foundations article</a>, where we provide an overview of OlympusDAO and who we are, what we’re building, and why we’re doing it.</p>\n<p>Olympus is being built with three supporting structures:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<a href="https://olympusdao.medium.com/olympus-fundamentals-preserving-purchasing-power-through-the-reserve-pillar-ab2d28028871"><strong>Reserve Pillar</strong></a><strong> </strong>to establish Purchasing Power</li>\n<li>\n<a href="https://olympusdao.medium.com/olympus-fundamentals-universal-acceptance-through-the-liquidity-pillar-83aaa10f92bb"><strong>Liquidity Pillar</strong></a><strong> </strong>to foster Universal Acceptance</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Utility Pillar </strong>to encourage High Usability</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In the last article, we dove deep into the <a href="https://olympusdao.medium.com/olympus-fundamentals-universal-acceptance-through-the-liquidity-pillar-83aaa10f92bb">Liquidity Pillar</a>, which is responsible for OHM’s tradeability and universal acceptance as a deeply liquid asset. Prior to that, we explained the <a href="https://olympusdao.medium.com/olympus-fundamentals-preserving-purchasing-power-through-the-reserve-pillar-ab2d28028871">Reserve Pillar</a> and its responsibility for OHM’s growth, stability, and positioning as a decentralized digital asset.</p>\n<p>With a solid reserve and robust liquidity pillar, the third and final supporting piece is the Utility Pillar.</p>\n<h3>The Utility Pillar</h3>\n<p>The Utility Pillar is responsible for how OHM is utilized throughout the digital economy. The ultimate purpose of having a trusted, backed, and deeply-liquid reserve asset is being able to use it with confidence. Whether that’s in the realm of decentralized finance, NFTs, or exploring the metaverse, we want to encourage anyone and everyone to use OHM across Web3. The concept of building utility can be categorized into two layers.</p>\n<p><a href="https://olympusdao.medium.com/building-an-econohmy-a5cf4e8671de"><strong>The EconOHMy</strong></a> is the first layer of this pillar. For a thriving ecosystem, there must be protocols and DAOs who build products and services that utilize OHM. The work here is to find, develop, and support integrations and partnerships that promote OHM as a utility. We’ve already launched a way to kickstart this.</p>\n<p><strong>Olympus Incubator &amp; Grants</strong>:</p>\n<p>As mentioned in the <a href="https://olympusdao.medium.com/olympus-fundamentals-universal-acceptance-through-the-liquidity-pillar-83aaa10f92bb">last article</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/Olympusincubate">Olympus Incubator</a> and <a href="http://grants.olympusdao.finance/">Olympus Grants</a> are our funding programs to bootstrap Olympus’ wider ecosystem. The incubator surpasses traditional “launchpads” by providing community support, mentorship, and effective strategies. Likewise, all of our grants will be directed to projects &amp; contributors that directly advance Olympus in ways that synchronize with emergent priorities of the DAO. It will grow the econOHMy by finding ways to connect with markets and communities currently underserved by Web3. There are three key focuses to the Grants program:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<em>Education </em>— projects that educate about Olympus</li>\n<li>\n<em>Infrastructure</em> — projects that improve/expand upon the infrastructure of Olympus</li>\n<li>\n<em>Utility </em>— projects that increase utility of OHM</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Partnerships:</strong></p>\n<p>Olympus has welcomed over 40 partners and counting in the econOHMy. Below are some of the partners we’ve had the privilege of working with:</p>\n<p><em>Frax, Klima DAO, Redacted Cartel, Lobis, Rome, Alchemix, Dopex, Inverse, Tokemak, Umami Finance, Debt DAO, Vesta, Volt, Exodia, Liquity, Phantom DAO, Prime DAO, Spirit Swap &amp; Fiat DAO.</em></p>\n<p>These aren’t just partnerships announcements for marketing’s sake. There are useful collaborations where Ohmies can use their OHM on many of these platforms. Here are some examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href="https://beets.fi/">BeethovenX</a> — A leading DEX and Balancer fork on the Fantom network that allows for weighted investment pools with up to 8 Tokens, including gOHM.</li>\n<li>\n<a href="https://www.dopex.io/">Dopex </a>— a decentralized options protocol which allows you to participate in Single Sided Options Vaults (SSOV).

      '\n<figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*LZtL3zNL2J9G6ejx"></figure><p>One of the most incredible facets of DeFi organizations is the fact that most things on the balance sheet are transparent if you know where to look. It is commonplace for protocols to list all of their smart contracts, treasury addresses, and multi-sig wallets in their official documents so that DeFi participants can see, on the ledger of the blockchain, what those protocols are holding. However, this is a double-edged sword. That information is often quite tedious to sift through, and may take you across many different block explorers or through multiple chains just to figure out where everything is.</p>\n<p><strong>Olympus disrupts all of this with the new Treasury Dashboard.</strong></p>\n<p>In an effort to bring you the most transparency with the least amount of investigation as possible, we constructed a centralized location where all of our decentralized assets can be viewed. Partnering with <a href="https://www.multifarm.fi/">Multifarm</a>, we are creating a dashboard that includes every bit of information you would ever need or want to know about the Treasury; its strategies, its held positions, and more. Allow this document to act as a guide to using the Treasury Dashboard.</p>\n<p>Let’s dive into some of the components:</p>\n<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>\n<p>This is the same section you know and love, which greets you when you enter the Olympus app every day to check your balances and see how the market is shaping up. We haven’t changed this at all as it already does a great job of giving you a bird’s eye view of Olympus at any given moment. The way we see it — if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it!</p>\n<p><strong>Treasury</strong></p>\n<p>Here is where things will begin to diverge from what you know and start to expand transparency for the average Ohmie. The treasury tab is broken down into 5 parts: portfolio, category, farm, strategies, and OHM backing.</p>\n<p>The <strong>Portfolio</strong> section displays all assets that are held by the Treasury, what blockchain those assets live on, and in what amounts they are held in. There are tooltips throughout each selection explaining the differences in the effort of true transparency, one of our main goals is to have everything plainly understood.</p>\n<figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*EJ-2DCj3fvjiFDA_"><figcaption>Treasury Portfolio</figcaption></figure><p>The <strong>Category</strong> section takes the portfolio a step further by breaking down all of the assets in each of their categorical groups. These being: reserve assets, protocol-owned liquidity, Olympus branch, Incubator, strategic assets, Olympus Pro, and an “other” section for assets that don’t quite fit into the previous categories.</p>\n<figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*QiMDrpMI4MHHR9xx"><figcaption>Treasury Categories</figcaption></figure><p>The next section, <strong>Farm</strong>, gives a serious analysis of all of Olympus Treasury’s farming positions, the amount of which those positions represent of the overall holdings, and the monthly revenue from our assets held on the behalf of our DAO partners.</p>\n<figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*V4xFv3yGc-o15_-B"><figcaption>Treasury Farms</figcaption></figure><p>Following this is <strong>Strategies</strong>, arguably one of the most important pages on the entire dashboard. Strategies will give Ohmies insight into the methods and mechanisms of the Treasury, and present each minutia of detail that goes into the strategy decisions behind the Treasury’s interest in certain assets. In complete transparency, you can now see what actions are taken by the Treasury of Olympus and why.</p>\n<figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*gtpwZ36fSvTJWcLW"><figcaption>Treasury Strategies</figcaption></figure><p>The last section is $<strong>OHM Backing</strong>, which will be incredibly insightful for those who have been intrigued by our recent release of Inverse Bonds. Laid out for you in descending dollar denomination is each liquid piece of an $OHM token. Ohmies can see exactly what is backing their currency at any given time, giving them translucent optics into the best backed token in DeFi.</p>\n<figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*mVq4Gb7nWcy_ZFPJ"><figcaption>Treasury $OHM Backing</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Revenue</strong></p>\n<p>Moving along from the Treasury tab, one can pan to the right and head to the Revenue tab. Inside of this branch of the dashboard, you get access to live numbers from each action of the Olympus Treasury that brings in revenue. That revenue in turn goes towards creating new OHM tokens and backing existing ones.</p>\n<p>Things are split up by section again here, with each section containing complete and detailed information, graphs, and analysis that seek to further expand our user’s scope of the revenue generated by the Olympus Treasury.</p>\n<p>The first section in Revenue is the <strong>Revenue Type</strong>.

      '\n<figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*LZtL3zNL2J9G6ejx"></figure><p>One of the most incredible facets of DeFi organizations is the fact that most things on the balance sheet are transparent if you know where to look. It is commonplace for protocols to list all of their smart contracts, treasury addresses, and multi-sig wallets in their official documents so that DeFi participants can see, on the ledger of the blockchain, what those protocols are holding. However, this is a double-edged sword. That information is often quite tedious to sift through, and may take you across many different block explorers or through multiple chains just to figure out where everything is.</p>\n<p><strong>Olympus disrupts all of this with the new Treasury Dashboard.</strong></p>\n<p>In an effort to bring you the most transparency with the least amount of investigation as possible, we constructed a centralized location where all of our decentralized assets can be viewed. Partnering with <a href="https://www.multifarm.fi/">Multifarm</a>, we are creating a dashboard that includes every bit of information you would ever need or want to know about the Treasury; its strategies, its held positions, and more. Allow this document to act as a guide to using the Treasury Dashboard.</p>\n<p>Let’s dive into some of the components:</p>\n<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>\n<p>This is the same section you know and love, which greets you when you enter the Olympus app every day to check your balances and see how the market is shaping up. We haven’t changed this at all as it already does a great job of giving you a bird’s eye view of Olympus at any given moment. The way we see it — if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it!</p>\n<p><strong>Treasury</strong></p>\n<p>Here is where things will begin to diverge from what you know and start to expand transparency for the average Ohmie. The treasury tab is broken down into 5 parts: portfolio, category, farm, strategies, and OHM backing.</p>\n<p>The <strong>Portfolio</strong> section displays all assets that are held by the Treasury, what blockchain those assets live on, and in what amounts they are held in. There are tooltips throughout each selection explaining the differences in the effort of true transparency, one of our main goals is to have everything plainly understood.</p>\n<figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*EJ-2DCj3fvjiFDA_"><figcaption>Treasury Portfolio</figcaption></figure><p>The <strong>Category</strong> section takes the portfolio a step further by breaking down all of the assets in each of their categorical groups. These being: reserve assets, protocol-owned liquidity, Olympus branch, Incubator, strategic assets, Olympus Pro, and an “other” section for assets that don’t quite fit into the previous categories.</p>\n<figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*QiMDrpMI4MHHR9xx"><figcaption>Treasury Categories</figcaption></figure><p>The next section, <strong>Farm</strong>, gives a serious analysis of all of Olympus Treasury’s farming positions, the amount of which those positions represent of the overall holdings, and the monthly revenue from our assets held on the behalf of our DAO partners.</p>\n<figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*V4xFv3yGc-o15_-B"><figcaption>Treasury Farms</figcaption></figure><p>Following this is <strong>Strategies</strong>, arguably one of the most important pages on the entire dashboard. Strategies will give Ohmies insight into the methods and mechanisms of the Treasury, and present each minutia of detail that goes into the strategy decisions behind the Treasury’s interest in certain assets. In complete transparency, you can now see what actions are taken by the Treasury of Olympus and why.</p>\n<figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*gtpwZ36fSvTJWcLW"><figcaption>Treasury Strategies</figcaption></figure><p>The last section is $<strong>OHM Backing</strong>, which will be incredibly insightful for those who have been intrigued by our recent release of Inverse Bonds. Laid out for you in descending dollar denomination is each liquid piece of an $OHM token. Ohmies can see exactly what is backing their currency at any given time, giving them translucent optics into the best backed token in DeFi.</p>\n<figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*mVq4Gb7nWcy_ZFPJ"><figcaption>Treasury $OHM Backing</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Revenue</strong></p>\n<p>Moving along from the Treasury tab, one can pan to the right and head to the Revenue tab. Inside of this branch of the dashboard, you get access to live numbers from each action of the Olympus Treasury that brings in revenue. That revenue in turn goes towards creating new OHM tokens and backing existing ones.</p>\n<p>Things are split up by section again here, with each section containing complete and detailed information, graphs, and analysis that seek to further expand our user’s scope of the revenue generated by the Olympus Treasury.</p>\n<p>The first section in Revenue is the <strong>Revenue Type</strong>. This is a simple and clear depiction of monthly revenue split into its different components. You’ll be able to see a line graph that tracks daily revenue over time for easy optics.</p>\n<figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*u5y4T2UZ3F64ryrX"><figcaption>Revenue Type</figcaption></figure><p>Next up is <strong>Farming Detailed</strong>, a section that shares a lot of common themes as the Farm section in the previous tab, but just adds more detail and color.
