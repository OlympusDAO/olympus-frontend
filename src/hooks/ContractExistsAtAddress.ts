  ~ What it does? ~

  Checks whether a contract exists on the blockchain, returns true if it exists, otherwise false

  ~ How can I use? ~

  const contractIsDeployed = useContractExistsAtAddress(localProvider, contractAddress);

  ~ Features ~

  - Provide contractAddress to check if the contract is deployed
  - Change provider to check contract address on different chains (ex. mainnetProvider)
