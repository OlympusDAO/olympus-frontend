## Rinkeby Testing

**Rinkeby faucet for sOHM:**
[Lives here](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0x800B3d87b77361F0D1d903246cA1F51b5acb43c9#writeContract), to retrieve test sOHM click `Connect to Web3` and use function #3: `dripSOHM`. After connecting to web3, click `Write` to execute and 10 sOHM will automatically be transferred to your connected wallet.

Note: The faucet is limited to one transfer per wallet every 6500 blocks (~1 day)

**Rinkeby faucets for LUSD, FRAX & DAI can be taken from rinkeby etherscan:**

1. Go to `src/helpers/AllBonds.ts`
2. then copy the rinkeby `reserveAddress` for the applicable bond & navigate to that contract on rinkeby etherscan. 
3. On Rinkeby etherscan use the `mint` function. You can use the number helper for 10^18 & then add four more zeros for 10,000 units of whichever reserve you are minting.

### Architecture/Layout
The app is written in [React](https://reactjs.org/) using [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) as the state container. 

The files/folder structure are a  **WIP** and may contain some unused files. The project is rapidly evolving so please update this section if you see it is inaccurate!

```
./src/
├── App.jsx       // Main app page
├── abi/          // Contract ABIs from etherscan.io

## 🚀 Deployment
Auto deployed on [Fleek.co](http://fleek.co/) fronted by [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/). Since it is hosted via IPFS there is no running "server" component and we don't have server sided business logic. Users are served an `index.html` and javascript to run our applications. 

_**TODO**: TheGraph implementation/how/why we use it._


### Continuous deployment
Commits to the follow branches are automatically deployed to their respective URLs.
| Branch | URL |
| --- | --- |
| master | https://app.olympusdao.finance |
| deploy | https://staging.olympusdao.finance |

**Pull Requests**:
Each PR into master will get its own custom URL that is visible on the PR page. QA & validate changes on that URL before merging into the deploy branch. 


## 👏🏽 Contributing Guidelines
